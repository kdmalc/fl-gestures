# Personalized Gesture Classification

Goal is to develop a cluster-based, one-/few-shot machine learning algorithm that can provide novel testing users with a strong performing gesture classification model, with little to no calibration/finetuning required. Once this has been completed in simulations, this will be verified in a real-time user study. Note that users are allowed to define their own gesture actions (gesture labels are fixed), and thus any individual gesture action may be novel.

## Datasets
- EMG+IMU data collected from 32 participants completing personalized gesture development tasks.
